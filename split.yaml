# IRC parser tests
# splitting, turning server strings into output

# most of the tests in here originate from grawity's test vectors
# https://github.com/grawity/code/tree/master/lib/tests

tests:
  # input is the string coming directly from the server to parse

  # the atoms dict has the keys:
  #   * tags: tags string, without single leading at sign
  #   * source: source string, without single leading colon
  #   * verb: verb string
  #   * params: params split up as a list
  # if the params key does not exist, assume it is empty
  # if any other keys do no exist, assume they are null
  # a key that is null does not exist or is not specified with the
  #   given input string

  # simple join
  - input: "foo bar baz asdf"
    atoms:
      verb: "foo"
      params:
        - "bar"
        - "baz"
        - "asdf"

  # simple join with source
  - input: ":coolguy foo bar baz asdf"
    atoms:
      source: "coolguy"
      verb: "foo"
      params:
        - "bar"
        - "baz"
        - "asdf"

  # simple join with trailing param
  - input: "foo bar baz :asdf quux"
    atoms:
      verb: "foo"
      params:
        - "bar"
        - "baz"
        - "asdf quux"
  
  - input: "foo bar baz :"
    atoms:
      verb: "foo"
      params:
        - "bar"
        - "baz"
        - ""
  
  - input: "foo bar baz ::asdf"
    atoms:
      verb: "foo"
      params:
        - "bar"
        - "baz"
        - ":asdf"

  # simple join with source and trailing param
  - input: ":coolguy foo bar baz :asdf quux"
    atoms:
      source: "coolguy"
      verb: "foo"
      params:
        - "bar"
        - "baz"
