# IRC parser tests
# joining atoms into sendable messages

# most of the tests in here originate from grawity's test vectors
#   https://github.com/grawity/code/tree/master/lib/tests
# some also come from Mozilla's test vectors
#   https://dxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/chat/protocols/irc/test/test_ircMessage.js

tests:
  # the atoms dict has the keys:
  #   * tags: tags dict
  #       tags with no equals sign have a value of true in this file
  #       tags with no value after = sign have a value of empty string
  #   * source: source string, without single leading colon
  #   * verb: verb string
  #   * params: params split up as a list
  # if the params key does not exist, assume it is empty
  # if any other keys do no exist, assume they are null
  # a key that is null does not exist or is not specified with the
  #   given input string

  # matches is a list of messages that match
